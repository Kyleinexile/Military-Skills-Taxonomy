"(Changed 31 Oct 2022)"
"1. Description of CIP Education Matrix:"
"1.1. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) provides a taxonomic scheme providing accurate tracking and reporting of"
"fields of study and program completions activity. CIP was originally developed by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for"
"Education Statistics (NCES) in 1980, with revisions occurring in 1985, 1990, and 2000. For more information on CIP codes and"
"descriptions, visit http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/Default.aspx?y=55. By using CIP codes, each AFS can define, specifically, entry"
"education requirements for the career field. CIP codes and associated descriptions are based on a tiered structure. An officer’s education"
"must be mapped to a CIP code and then used for accession into an AFS."
""
"1.2. CIP Education Matrix Rule set."
"1.2.1. For entry into the AFS, it is mandatory that an officer accession meet at least one of the tiers listed in the CIP matrix for the AFS in"
"which they are to be accessed. Each AFS has a different set of requirements and tier structure. If an officer doesn’t meet any of the tier"
"requirements in the matrix, they are not qualified to enter the AFS. Each tier in the matrix contains definitions for the following: target"
"accession rates, CIP codes and associated descriptions of the CIP codes, and requirement type for entry in the AFS tier."
"1.2.2. Target Accession Rates are defined in each AFS’s CIP Education Matrix. Tier 1 target accession rates are generally the largest"
"because the desired population for each AFS should be a Tier 1 officer. Tier 2 and tier 3 target accession rates follow suit. There are some"
"AFSs which have only one tier due to the strict educational entry requirements. 61CXN and 61DXN have only one tier defined with target"
"accession rates for these AFSCs being 100%. When distributing officer accessions across the education needs of all AFSs, tier 1"
"requirements are considered first until the pool of available accessions with matching education has been exhausted. Tier 2 accessions will"
"then be considered, then tier 3, and so on. When the remaining accessions do not match tier requirements for a specific AFS, the career"
"field will stop accessing new officers for the year and the remaining accessions will enter other AFSs with more compatible education"
"requirements."

"SECTION III"
"OFFICER SPECIAL EXPERIENCE IDENTIFIERS"
"Introduction"
"(Changed 31 Oct 24)"
"1. Special Experience Identifiers (SEI). SEIs complement other classification tools to provide the means to record and retrieve specific"
"experience and training to satisfy management needs. Requests to establish, delete, or revise SEIs are according to the Air Force Career"
"Field Managers’ Guide available in myFSS (NOTE: To access the embedded link: right-click, select “copy link location,” paste the link"
"in an Internet Browser, and select Air Force Career Field Managers’ Guide located on the Active Duty: Military Classifications Page in"
"myFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page. To search the myFSS knowledge base, type Career Field Managers’ Guide into"
"the Search Knowledge Article Box, then select Career Field Managers’ Guide from the drop-down menu listing)."
"NOTE: *save files to the desktop/folder to view attachments*"
""
"2. The Alphanumeric Structure. The officer SEI is a three-character alphanumeric code, consisting of an activity code (first character)"
"and an experience set (last two characters). The activity code identifies possible activities performed in a variety of utilization fields."
"Section III-A lists activity codes and definitions. An experience set identifies a particular system, level of experience, or the type of"
"experience. Section III-B contains authorized experience sets. Activity codes may be used with any experience set to form a SEI."
""
"3. Use of SEIs. SEIs provide a method to quickly screen the officer database for specific experience, and SEIs may be used in the officer"
"assignment process. Interaction of activity codes with experience sets and the broad application guidelines relating to AFSC- SEI"
"relationship (no AFSC constraints) provide assignment officers the capability for finite identification of experience, training, and"
"qualifications to use in meeting management needs."
""
"4. Functional Users and Manpower Responsibilities. Over 46,000 separate SEI codes are possible in the officer SEI program when"
"combining the Activity Code and Experience Set. The size of such a system, coupled with no MilPDS edits on officer SEIs to any"
"particular AFSC, limits ability of any single agency to control placement of SEIs on unit manpower documents. Functional users are the"
"most important link in the success of the officer SEI program and benefit most by the SEI program. Functional users must frequently"
"review each position under their areas of responsibility to determine appropriateness of identifying positions by SEI. Using the following"
"criteria may be helpful: Is the officer filling the position gaining special experience identified by a current SEI in this instruction? Does"
"the position require special experience identified by a current SEI? If the answer to either of these questions is yes, then coding the"
"position with the SEI is appropriate."
""
"5. Award and Withdrawal of Officer SEIs. Unit commanders award SEIs and the servicing MPS updates MilPDS. SEIs are awarded"
"when an officer has completed the qualification criteria listed in this attachment for a particular experience set. The process for awarding"
"and requesting withdrawal of an SEI is contained in the Special Experience Identifier (SEI) PSD Guide (NOTE: To access the"
"embedded link: right-click, select “copy link location,” paste the link in an Internet Browser, and select the Special Experience Identifier"
"(SEI) PSD Guide located on the Active Duty: Military Classifications Page in myFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page. To"
"search the myFSS knowledge base, type Military Classifications into the Search Knowledge Article Box, then select Active Duty: Military"
"Classifications from the drop-down menu listing)."
"NOTE: *save files to the desktop/folder to view attachments*"
""
"6. . An SEI may be withdrawn because of loss of qualification for award (loss of security clearance, medical disqualification, and so"
"forth). An SEI is automatically withdrawn during the AFSC Conversion cycle when its component activity code or experience set is"
"removed from the inventory of available SEIs."
