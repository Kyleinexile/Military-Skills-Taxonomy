"SPECIAL WARFARE CAREER FIELD (1Z)"
"Introduction"
"(Established 31 Oct 19)"
"The specialties included in the Special Warfare Career Field form the Air Force's premier ground maneuver element. The Airmen of"
"Special Warfare are employed across the spectrum of conflict to extend Air Force air power and enhance its lethality. They operate within"
"the Joint and Combined Force to build partnerships, develop asymmetric advantages, and engage the enemy inside its own region. They"
"provide the connective tissue required to bind multiple domains; focusing the integration of air, space, cyber and land issues through the"
"lens of airpower from the ground up and delivering distinctive capability and expertise in any operating environment with unequaled"
"lethality, accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility, and persistence. This career field includes the functions and activities of global access,"
"precision strike and personnel recovery."
"Global access includes special operations designed to prepare the environment and establish physical or cyber access to forward"
"battlespaces for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), forward air lodgment, proxy development, air infrastructural"
"development, target development, and asymmetric effects to accomplish the supported commander’s tactical, operational, and strategic"
"goals."
"Precision strike encompasses terminal attack control, managing a variety of non-kinetic effects as well as kinetic fires from land, maritime"
"and air based platforms to achieve the supported commander’s desired battlefield effects."
"Personnel Recovery involves all efforts designed to recover and reintegrate any designated individuals who become isolated from friendly"
"control. A significant subset of PR is performing the same actions for sensitive equipment that could be harmful to the United States, or"
"our Allies should it fall in the wrong hands."
"Special Warfare airmen may be employed alone or as part of a Special Warfare, Air Force, joint, interagency, or coalition force in support"
"of Combatant Commander’s objectives. They are capable of rapid deployment during day or night, to any environment, including"
"permissive, hostile, denied, or politically and/or diplomatically sensitive locales. They operate in all six geographic disciplines: mountain,"
"desert, arctic, urban, jungle and water. The career field may operate under austere conditions for extended periods."

"The Air Force Chaplain Corps Vision is ‘To care for Airmen, Guardians and families more than anyone thinks possible.” Although"
"Religious Affairs Airmen facilitate religious freedom at home base, contingency, and deployed locations, being religious is not a"
"requirement for this career field, but caring for ALL Airmen, Guardians, and their families is essential. Religious Affairs Airmen perform"
"in a manner respectful of a diverse, pluralistic religious environment to support all faith groups and all service members, to include service"
"members who are not religious. 5R0s provide administrative and logistical support for Worship Services and Religious Programs. They"
"support spiritual fitness, resiliency, marriage and family, singles, and healthy relationship events. Religious Affairs Airmen typically"
"operate in Religious Support Teams which consists of one Air Force Chaplain and one Religious Affairs Airman. This is modeled at every"
"level of the Chaplain Corps. Religious Support Teams aim to be out and about with our Airmen and Guardians frequently. 5R0s advise"
"leaders at all levels on matters pertaining to faith, religious accommodation, ethics, and morale concerns. Another aspect of this career"
"field is crisis intervention and solution focused counseling: This is intended to be short-term interactions during which the primary goal is"
"to stabilize the person in crisis, identify referral resources, and escort to care. The Religious Affairs Airmen Career Field is a unique field"
"that offers opportunities to see the best and worst in people. This can be, and is often a rewarding career field, but it can also be draining"
"on your own personal resilience. Resiliency and spiritual fitness are important aspects of the Air Force, and our role is to inspire readiness"
"for the warfighter and their family to support the mission."

"AIR ADVISOR FUNCTIONAL CATEGORY (8LXXX)"
"Introduction"
"(Established 31 Oct 19)"
"The Air Advisor function involves specially trained Airmen utilizing their primary Air Force functional subject matter expertise to assess,"
"train, advise, assist, and when authorized equip (ATAAE) foreign partner forces to develop their own internal aviation capacity and"
"capability. In this functional category qualified conventional force airmen are Air Advisors trained and educated through USAF"
"educations and training programs and standards; Combat Aviation Advisors are special operations airmen trained through Air Force"
"Special Operations Command training programs certified through United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) standards."
"Missions conducted by Airmen in this functional category include Security Force Assistance (SFA) as part of broader U.S. security"
"cooperation initiatives to organize, train, re-build/build, equip, and assist (OTERA) foreign security forces to develop their own"
"capabilities. Missions take place across the range of military operations in both permissive and contested environments, under steady- state"
"or surge conditions, and under politically sensitive environments where an overt U.S. presence is unacceptable to the host-nation"
"government; environments where a limited, overt presence is acceptable, and under conditions where a large-scale U.S. presence is"
"considered necessary and acceptable. In addition to mastery and qualification in their primary AFSC, education, training, and experience"
"in this functional category, Air Advisor missions require knowledge and skills in individual and collective force protection; language,"
"regional, cultural expertise; foreign disclosure requirements, authorities, polices, and funding unique to security cooperation and other"
"operations including but not limited to foreign internal defense, COIN, and unconventional warfare; conduct of assessments of host nation"
"SFA needs; baseline cultural and language skills in furtherance of SFA objectives; methods for mission assessment, measurement, and"
"evaluation; knowledge and awareness of international law and governance, and attributes required to work in challenging cross-cultural"
"settings often under arduous conditions while working with indigenous forces to safely and effectively employ their aviation capabilities"
"in support of combatant commander campaign plan objectives."

"SPECIAL EXPERIENCE IDENTIFIERS"
"Introduction"
"(Changed 30 Apr 21)"
"1. Special Experience Identifiers (SEI). The SEIs in this attachment identify special experience and training not otherwise identified"
"within the military personnel data system (MilPDS). SEIs complement the assignment process but are not substitutes for AFSCs/SFSCs,"
"CEM codes, prefixes, suffixes, SDIs, RIs, personnel processing codes, and professional specialty course codes. They are established when"
"identifying experience or training is critical to the job and person assignment match, and no other identification is appropriate or available."
"SEIs permit rapid identification of a resource already experienced to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or"
"management needs. They provide a means to track individuals and identify positions requiring or providing unique experience or training"
"that otherwise would be lost. SEIs may be used to better distribute personnel and optimize the job and person match insofar as possible."
""
"2. Authorized AFSCs/SFSCs. Normally, AFSCs/SFSCs and CEM codes listed as authorized for use with SEIs refer to the basic"
"AFSC/SFSC plus all shredouts. All authorized skill levels of the basic AFSC/SFSC are listed, including 9-skill levels and CEMs. If an"
"AFSC/SFSC is listed with the first 5 digits and an “X” in the 6th position, i.e.: 3P051X, then the SEI is authorized for use with the basic"
"AFSC/SFSC and all suffixes authorized with that AFSC/SFSC. If an “X” is used in the skill level position it means that all skill levels are"
"authorized for use with the SEI."
""
"3. SEI Structure. The SEI code is composed of three numeric characters or three alphanumeric characters. Individual characters within"
"the codes have no specific meaning. Most SEIs are authorized for award with specific AFSCs/SFSCs; some are authorized with any"
"AFSC/SFSC."
""
"4. Establishing SEIs. Requests to establish, delete, or revise SEIs must be submitted according to the instructions provided in the Air"
"Force Career Field Manager’s Guide available at the myFSS Web Site. (Note: To access the embedded link: right-click, select “copy link"
"location,” paste the link in an Internet Browser, and select the Air Force Career Field Manager’s Guide located on the Active Duty:"
"Military Classifications Page in myFSS; or navigate direct from the myFSS Home Page. To search the myFSS knowledge base, type in"
"Career Field Manager’s Guide into the Search Knowledge Article Box, then select Career Field Manager’s Guide from the drop-"
"down menu listing. *Save a copy of the file to the desktop/folder to view attachments*"
""
"5. SEI Fields in the MilPDS. SEIs that may be concurrently recorded in an airman record are currently set to five with the primary"
"AFSC, five with the 2AFSC, four with the 3AFSC, three with the 4AFSC, and one in the general SEI area. Computer edits ensure the"
"AFSC-SEI combinations are valid. The general area is used for SEIs authorized with any AFSC. A general SEI is used as a marker in the"
"Personnel system to show a specific type of training or experience available to any Airman/Guardians. This experience is not limited by"
"AFSC/SFSC. CAFSC SEI is not used by base level to award a SEI to the member. CAFSC SEI reflects an SEI code attached to the"
"position the member is assigned and will reflect as the CAFSC SEI as a suspense indicator. If the member is not expected to gain the"
"experience required to be awarded the SEI designated to the position, they should be removed from that position."
""
"6. MilPDS-Generated SEI Award Notification (Personnel Services Delivery Guide - Special Experience Identifier (SEI) Process.) The"
"CAFSC is designated with the SEI when an enlisted airman is assigned to a unit manpower document (UMD) position identified with the"
"SEI. For SEIs designated as auto-notify, once experience and training requirements have been satisfied a MilPDS suspense notification"
"will be provided as a reminder to award the SEI. Award suspense is performed for numeric SEIs only. For SEIs designated as auto-award,"
"once experience and training requirements have been satisfied, MilPDS will award the SEI to the member. It will do so unless the member"
"is removed from the SEI-coded position or the commander directs a change to the award suspense date prior to meeting the experience"
"requirement."

"1. Description and General Duties. CEM codes contained in this attachment identify all chief master sergeant positions in the Enlisted"
"Classification Structure. They also identify chief master sergeants that, through extensive experience and training, have demonstrated"

"will be subject to working in a variety of similar jobs and functional areas where their general managerial and supervisory abilities can be"
"most effectively used and challenged."

"1. These instructions establish the parameters for recruiting prior military service personnel with needed experience and training"
"equivalent to an existing Air Force specialty. Prior service applicants, eligible for enlistment in the Air Force and possessing a convertible"
"skill listed on the attached conversion list, may be awarded the 3-skill level AFSC provided the applicant meets the below eligibility"
"criteria. Documentation of formal training completion is required."
