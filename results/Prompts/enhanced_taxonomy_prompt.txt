
I have a dataset containing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) and their associated skills. I need you to create a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of military skills based on this data.

Here is a representative sample of the dataset:

```json

This is a portion of the dataset. The full dataset contains information for all Air Force Specialty Codes, organized by category (Officer and Enlisted), with each AFSC having associated skills and relevance scores.

Please create a structured military skills taxonomy with the following requirements:

1. STRUCTURE:
   - Level 1: Major Skill Domains (6-8 broad categories like "Technical Operations", "Leadership & Management", etc.)
   - Level 2: Skill Categories (subcategories within each domain)
   - Level 3: Specific Skills (individual skills or competencies)
   - Level 4: Specific Applications or Subskills (where appropriate)

2. FORMAT:
   - Present the taxonomy as a hierarchical outline
   - Include clear headers for each level
   - Cross-reference where appropriate to show relationships between skills across domains
   - Include at least 8-10 specific skills per skill category for comprehensive coverage

3. CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
   - Focus on action-oriented skills (verbs/capabilities)
   - Prioritize skills with high relevance scores (70+) and "high" confidence
   - Group similar skills together even if they use different terminology
   - Emphasize military context and Air Force-specific applications
   - Include appropriate skill level indicators (basic, intermediate, advanced) where appropriate
   - Ensure coverage of both Officer and Enlisted skill requirements

4. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - This taxonomy will serve as a baseline for defining operational staff needs
   - It should enhance resource allocation and training program development
   - The taxonomy should be useful across different AFSCs and be scalable to other military services
   - Include examples of how the taxonomy could be applied in practice (e.g., for training development)

5. VISUALIZATION SUGGESTIONS:
   - Provide suggestions for 3-4 visualization types that would effectively represent this taxonomy
   - Include brief descriptions of how each visualization would help understand the taxonomy
   - Suggest specific tools or approaches for implementing these visualizations

Please format the taxonomy as follows:

I. MAJOR SKILL DOMAIN
   A. Skill Category
      1. Specific Skill (relevant AFSCs: XXX, XXX)
         - Subskill/Application
         - Additional applications
      2. Specific Skill
   B. Skill Category

II. MAJOR SKILL DOMAIN
    ...

For each skill, include:
- Brief description
- Primary associated verb(s)
- Key AFSCs where this skill is most relevant
- Confidence level (derived from the data)

Please also provide a detailed explanation of your methodology and organizing principles for creating this taxonomy, including how this taxonomy could be further developed and applied in military contexts.
