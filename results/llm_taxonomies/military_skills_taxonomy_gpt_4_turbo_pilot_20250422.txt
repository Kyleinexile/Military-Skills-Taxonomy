### Methodology
This taxonomy was formulated from an analysis of the provided dataset containing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). Each skill was assessed for relevance and confidence, focusing on those with high ratings. Skills were organized into major domains and categories based on similarities in actions and operational contexts. This structured approach ensures clarity and relevance, aligning military operational needs with specific skill sets.

### Visualisation Ideas
- Create a flowchart diagram representing the hierarchy from Major Domains to Specific Skills.
- Develop a heatmap visualizing the frequency and distribution of core skills across different AFSCs.
- Construct an interactive dashboard that allows users to drill down from Major Domains to Sub-skills.
- Use a network graph to show the interconnections between different skills and their applications in real-world operations.
